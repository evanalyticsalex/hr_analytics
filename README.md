# 📊 HR Attrition Analysis | evanalytics.Corp

This project was created for evanalytics. Corp as a showcase of how HR attrition data can be used to support financial forecasting, workforce planning, and scenario modeling — all critical to modern FP&A (Financial Planning & Analysis) roles.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Use HR data to simulate real-world challenges a financial analyst may face:
- Modeling the cost of employee attrition
- Identifying retention bottlenecks
- Proposing data-driven recommendations

---

## 🧠 Working Hypotheses

1. Employees with **low income, high overtime, and low satisfaction** are more likely to leave — affecting hiring and training budgets.
2. **Departments with high attrition** also show high variance in tenure and performance scores — suggesting inefficiencies.
3. **Younger employees** leave more often — which lowers ROI on onboarding investment.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code (with Git Bash)
- Tableau or Power BI (optional)
